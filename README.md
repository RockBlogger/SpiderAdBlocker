# Anti-AdBlocker - SpiderAdBlocker

SpiderAdBlocker is a JavaScript code developed by rockblogger to detect and prevent the use of ad-blockers on websites. Ad-blockers have become a major concern for website owners, as they prevent ads from being displayed and negatively impact revenue generation. SpiderAdBlocker offers a solution to this problem by allowing website owners to detect and block users who are using ad-blockers, ensuring that ads are displayed and revenue is generated.

To install SpiderAdBlocker, simply add the following code to the </body> section of your website:
```
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rockblogger/SpiderAdBlocker/v3/code.min.js'>
</script>

```

This will load the SpiderAdBlocker JavaScript code from the CDN, allowing it to run on your website. Once installed, website owners can customize the code to suit their needs and preferences.

The latest version of SpiderAdBlocker, V 3.0, comes with a lot of improvements in design, compatibility, and overall functionality. It has been extensively tested and works seamlessly on all browsers and extensions, even with AdGuard DNS. The new design is more user-friendly and efficient, making it easier to use and access by a wider audience. Additionally, the code has been updated to ensure better compatibility with different browser configurations.

We encourage website owners to use this tool and upgrade to the latest version to enjoy the improved design and performance. Please feel free to provide any feedback or support.
